## **Basic Level Questions**

### 1. Tree Creation and Traversals
- Create a binary tree.
- Implement **Inorder**, **Preorder**, and **Postorder** traversals.
- Perform **Level-order traversal** (Breadth-First Search).

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
- Insert a node into a BST.
- Search for a value in a BST.
- Find the minimum and maximum values in a BST.
- Delete a node from a BST.

### 3. Height of a Tree
- Write a function to calculate the height of a binary tree.

### 4. Count Nodes
- Count:
  - Total number of nodes.
  - Number of leaf nodes.
  - Number of non-leaf nodes.

### 5. Mirror of a Tree
- Create a mirror image of a binary tree.

### 6. Check if Two Trees are Identical
- Compare two binary trees to determine if they are identical in structure and values.

## **Intermediate Level Questions**

### 1. Check for Balanced Tree
- Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced.

### 2. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- Find the Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

### 3. Check if a Tree is a BST
- Verify if a binary tree satisfies the properties of a Binary Search Tree.

### 4. Boundary Traversal
- Print the boundary nodes of a binary tree in an anti-clockwise direction.

### 5. Level-wise Node Printing
- Print all nodes level by level, with each level on a new line.

### 6. Vertical Order Traversal
- Print nodes of a binary tree in vertical order.

### 7. Diameter of a Tree
- Calculate the diameter (longest path between any two nodes) of a binary tree.

### 8. Find kth Smallest/Largest Element in BST
- Retrieve the kth smallest or largest element in a Binary Search Tree.

### 4. Path Sum Problems
- Check if a root-to-leaf path exists with a given sum.
- Print all root-to-leaf paths that sum to a specific value.

### 5. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
- Flatten a binary tree into a linked list in-place.

### 6. Tree Diameter (Optimized Approach)
- Calculate the diameter of a binary tree using a single DFS traversal.

### 7. Maximum Path Sum
- Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

### 8. Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)
- Implement a Fenwick Tree for efficient range queries and updates.

### 9. Check if Two Trees are Isomorphic
- Determine if two binary trees can be transformed into each other by swapping left and right children.

### 10. AVL Tree Implementation
- Implement an AVL Tree with rotation logic for insertion and deletion.

## **Preparation Tips**

1. **Understand Tree Concepts**
   - Master basic concepts like binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and AVL trees.

2. **Focus on Traversals**
   - Practice Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, and Level-order traversals as they form the basis of most problems.

3. **Dynamic Memory Management**
   - Be proficient with pointers, `malloc`, and `free` for creating and managing trees in C.

4. **Optimize Solutions**
   - Aim for efficient algorithms with clear time and space complexity analysis.

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Test your solutions for edge cases such as empty trees, single-node trees, and highly unbalanced trees.
