# Sorting Programs in C

This document provides a categorized list of various sorting programs implemented in C. It includes sorting tasks for different data structures and advanced concepts.

## String Sorting
1. Sort an array of strings alphabetically
2. Sort characters of a single string alphabetically
3. Sort a string array in descending order and aescending order
4. Case-insensitive sorting of strings
5. Sort strings by length

## Character Sorting
6. Sort an array of characters (e.g., A-Z or a-z)
7. Sort characters in a single string alphabetically
8. Sort characters in a string ignoring case

## Array/Matrix Sorting
9. Sort a 2D matrix row-wise
10. Sort a 2D matrix column-wise
11. Sort a jagged array row-wise

## Hybrid and Specialized Sorting
12. Sort integers with only positive numbers
13. Sort integers with negative and positive numbers
- Sort an array with duplicate elements
- Sort an array with unique elements only
- Sort a partially sorted array (nearly sorted)
- Sort a rotated sorted array
- Sort using a custom comparator function

## Custom Data Types Sorting
- Sort an array of structures (e.g., students by marks, employees by salary)
- Sort a linked list (ascending/descending)
- Sort a doubly linked list
- Sort a circular linked list

## Advanced Concepts
- Sort using Divide and Conquer
- Stable vs. Unstable sorting (implement examples)
- Comparison-based sorting vs. Non-comparison-based sorting
- Sort a large dataset using external sorting (file-based sorting)
