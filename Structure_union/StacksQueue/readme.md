## Stack Programs

### 1. Implement Stack Using Arrays
Implement a basic stack data structure using arrays, supporting standard operations like `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.

### 2. Implement Stack Using Linked List
Create a stack using a linked list to dynamically manage stack size, implementing `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations.

### 3. Balanced Parentheses
Write a program that checks if the parentheses (including `{}`, `[]`, `()`) in a given string are balanced.

### 4. Evaluate Postfix Expression
Given a postfix expression, evaluate it using a stack to manage operands and operators.

### 5. Infix to Postfix Conversion
Convert an infix expression to postfix notation using stacks to manage operator precedence.

### 6. Next Greater Element
Find the next greater element for each element in an array using a stack for efficient processing.

### 7. Sort a Stack
Write a function to sort a stack in ascending order using only push and pop operations (no additional data structures).

### 8. Implement Min Stack
Implement a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time, along with standard stack operations.

## Queue Programs

### 1. Implement Queue Using Arrays
Implement a queue using an array, supporting enqueue, dequeue, `front`, and `isEmpty` operations.

### 2. Implement Queue Using Linked List
Create a queue using a linked list to allow dynamic resizing, implementing enqueue and dequeue operations.

### 3. Implement Circular Queue
Implement a circular queue to reuse empty space in the array after elements are dequeued.

### 4. Implement Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
Implement a deque with `addFront`, `addRear`, `removeFront`, and `removeRear` operations.

### 5. Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to N Using Queue
Use a queue to generate binary numbers from `1` to a given number `N`.

### 6. First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream
Given a stream of characters, find the first non-repeating character at each point in the stream using a queue.

### 7. LRU Cache Implementation
Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using a combination of queue and hash map for efficient access and update.

### 8. Reverse a Queue
Reverse the order of elements in a queue using recursion or a stack.
