## Key Topics to Focus On  

### **Stack Programs**  
- **Balanced Parentheses**  
  Write a program that checks if the parentheses (including `{}`, `[]`, `()`) in a given string are balanced.  

- **Evaluate Postfix Expression**  
  Given a postfix expression, evaluate it using a stack to manage operands and operators.  

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**  
  Convert an infix expression to postfix notation using stacks to manage operator precedence.  

- **Next Greater Element**  
  Find the next greater element for each element in an array using a stack for efficient processing.  

- **Implement Min Stack**  
  Implement a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time, along with standard stack operations.

### **Queue Programs**  
- **Implement Circular Queue**  
  Implement a circular queue to reuse empty space in the array after elements are dequeued.  

- **Implement Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**  
  Implement a deque with `addFront`, `addRear`, `removeFront`, and `removeRear` operations.  

- **First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream**  
  Given a stream of characters, find the first non-repeating character at each point in the stream using a queue.  

- **LRU Cache Implementation**  
  Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using a combination of queue and hash map for efficient access and updates.

These selected programs are essential for mastering concepts relevant to interviews, especially for roles involving low-level programming or memory management like **embedded systems development**.
