   ### General apporaches this
   Each letter has a specific pattern, and we  need to write custom logic for each one. The steps are generally:
   1. Determine the height and width of the letter.
   2. Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column of the grid.
   3. Use conditional statements to print * or a space based on the pattern of the letter.
   This approach can be extended to any letter by carefully analyzing the pattern and writing the corresponding logic in the nested loops.
